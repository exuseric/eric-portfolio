        Hi, I'm Eric â€” I combine
        <mark>web fundamentals with modern web techniques</mark> to create
        products that are focused on being accessible, performant and
        responsive.

    <p>
      I love the web and spend a significant portion of my time rummaging
      through it for entertainment, learning and creative inspiration and
      through my travels I got hooked on accessibility and ever since I've spent
      most of my time trying to understand how I can build applications that
      offer good visual, functional and accessible design.
